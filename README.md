# NoReply

This is the source of [this](https://marknoble.github.io/noreply/) website.

## Build

There is a Github Action in place to deploy any changes to `index.md` to the
`index.html` site when pushing to `master` branch.

To generate the HTML file from Markdown manually,
[pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) is used:

```
pandoc --standalone --metadata pagetitle="noreply" --css "assets/css/pandoc.css" --output=index.html index.md
```
